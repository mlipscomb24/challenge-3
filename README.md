# Challenge-3
Challenge 3 - create a payroll tracker to see the payroll data so that the user can properly budget for the company. The tracker should allow for the user to submit First Name, Last Name and Salary.


## About This Project

In this project we had to create arrays for employees, for loop to allow the user to continue to add employees, and a way to store the data to allow for averages to be populated.
